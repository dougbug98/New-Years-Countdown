# New-Years-Countdown
A New Years Countdown to 2024 created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
My endeavor involved developing a JavaScript New Year's countdown for 2024. I created a countdown timer that dynamically generated the numbers and retrieved the current date and time from my computer. Users were provided with an accurate representation of the time remaining until the start of 2024.
